## RESEARCH
It is almost impossible for us to imagine mathematics without a calculator. An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics. Calculators are used in a comprehensive mathematics curriculum to increase the quality of student learning experience. Without calculators, advanced math courses, such as Calculus, would require much longer time to solve. The calculators we know today were not invented until the 1970s, and the use of smartphones as calculators did not begin until at least the late nineties.

## DIFFERENT TYPES OF CALCULATORS:

1. **ABACUS:**
               Abacus is the first tool created specifically for use in mathematical computations. It was invented by Sumerians and Egyptians in 2500 BC. The abacus is a table of successive columns with beads or stones representing a single unit, which could be used for addition or subtraction.\
   CONS:\
         1. It is not useful for multiplication or division.

2. **PASCAL CALCULATOR:**
                          Pascal Calculator was invented in 1642 by a french inventor and mathematician Blaise Pascal. It performed calculations through a clockwork-type of mechanism.and was lauded for attempting arithmetic calculations which was previously thought impossible.\
    CONS:\
          1. Production of these type of calculators was difficult.\
          2. Bulky in size.
          
3. **MECHANIC CALCULATOR:**
                            Curt Herzstark invented the first handheld, mechanical calculator in 1945. In 1970, a company in Japan invented the first digital pocket calculator. Companies like Texas Instruments, adapted the design of the Japanese device, and enhanced it by creating the graphing calculators we know today.
                            
4. **SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR:**
                              The first scientific calculator was invented  in 1968. The HP-35, introduced on February 1, 1972, was the first pocket calculator and the world's first handheld scientific calculator. Texas Instruments (TI), after the production of several units with scientific notation, introduced a handheld scientific calculator on January 15, 1974. TI-30 series is one of the most widely used scientific calculators in classrooms.
                              
5. **SMARTPHONE:**
                    With the invention of the first smartphone in 1995, individuals began to replace expensive digital calculators with the multi use device. This required even the most sophisticated calculator designs to be upgraded in order to remain relevant in the market.
