It is almost impossible for us to imagine mathematics without a calculator. An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics. Calculators are used in a comprehensive mathematics curriculum to increase the quality of student learning experience. Without calculators, advanced math courses, such as Calculus, would require much longer time to solve. The calculators we know today were not invented until the 1970s, and the use of smartphones as calculators did not begin until at least the late nineties.

## DIFFERENT TYPES OF CALCULATORS:

1. **ABACUS:**
               Abacus is the first tool created specifically for use in mathematical computations. It was invented by Sumerians and Egyptians in 2500 BC. The abacus is a table of successive columns with beads or stones representing a single unit, which could be used for addition or subtraction.
