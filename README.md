Calculator built by Team 6 of Aryabhatta

An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics. Calculators are used in a comprehensive mathematics curriculum to increase the quality of student learning experience. Without calculators, advanced math courses, such as Calculus, would require much longer time to solve.

Our Calculator - **Arya Calculator** is designed to do the following functions:
1. Scientific notation
2. Floating-point arithmetic
3. Logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e
4. Exponential functions and roots beyond the square root
5. Quick access to constants such as pi and exp
6. Equation solving.
7. Conversion  of  Units.
