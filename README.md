Calculator built by Team 6 of Aryabhatta

An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics. Calculators are used in a comprehensive mathematics curriculum to increase the quality of student learning experience. Without calculators, advanced math courses, such as Calculus, would require much longer time to solve.

Our Calculator - **Arya Calculator** is designed to do the following functions:
1. Scientific notation
2. Floating-point arithmetic
3. Exponential functions.
4. Calculate factorial of a number.
5. Calculate the power of a number.
6. Remainder in a division.
7. Calculate percentage.
